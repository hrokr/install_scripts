# First thoughts. Not tested and nowhere near ready

## What's the goal?
We're looking to be able to take a stock Apple or Linux computer and auto-
install all the prerequisite programs, add-ons and settings to clone the functionality.

There's a good deal to learn, needless to say. Aside from familiarization with
homebrew, iTerm, zsh, oh-my-zsh, tmux, vim and the packages that make them go
from stock performance to greatly enhanced productivity, there is that part
about a making a shell that will install of it is on the first go -- or have a
good way of dealing with it.
