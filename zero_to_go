# We're looking to be able to take a stock Apple or Linux computer and auto-
# install all the prerequisite programs, add-ons and settings to clone the functionality.

# homebrew, iTerm, zsh, oh-my-zsh, tmux, vim and the packages that make them go
# from stock performance to greatly enhanced productivity, there is that part
# about a making a shell that will install of it is on the first go -- or have a
# good way of dealing with it.
